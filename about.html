              <p>While <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-cannabis-stocks-to-buy-now"> multi-state
                  cannabis corporations </a> funded by investors around the world rake in billions of dollars,
                Jonathan Wall, age 25 years old faces a 15-year prison sentence for marijuana distribution.</p>
              <p><i> “Jonathan Wall is sitting in a federal supermax in Maryland for selling cannabis, something that
                corporations
                are doing right now across the country,” criminal defense attorney Jason Flores-Williams, Wall’s legal
                counsel,
                argues. “You can buy weed and donuts in Washington D.C., but 45 minutes away in Baltimore, my client is
                locked in a cage.&quot;</i></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Flores-Williams continues, <i> &quot;People can&#39;t believe it. </i> &quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, it would be unbelievable if the United States criminal legal system weren’t such a stunning example of
            inhumanity and hypocrisy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that the venture capitalist class can turn a profit being legal drug dealers, the so-called War on Drugs
            can no longer be disguised as a moral battle for the soul of society—as draconian policies would have us
            believe. Working-class and cash poor people are still being disproportionately targeted and arrested on
            marijuana-related charges, and many formerly incarcerated people are prohibited from participating in the
            nation’s fastest growing industry .
          </p>

          <p>
            There can be no denying that the drug war is nothing more than a systemic tool of oppression weaponized by a
            police state pretending to believe in fairness, equity, and justice. As Human Rights Watch found in its 2009
            report, Decades of Disparity: Drug Arrests and Race in the United States , “The human as well as social,
            economic and political toll is as incalculable as it is unjust.”
          </p>

          <p>
            As of May 18, 2021, 36 states and 4 territories allow for the medical use of cannabis products , while 17
            states,
            two territories and D.C. have legalized recreational cannabis use for adults. The U.S. cannabis industry is
            now
            worth an estimated $61 billion; and in 2020, the nation’s cannabis sales “hit a record $17.5 billion, a 46%
            increase from 2019,” Forbes reports. In alignment with those numbers, support for legal marijuana is at an
            all-
            time high of 68%. Still, even with the passage of legislation such as California’s Prop 64, the War on Drugs
            continues.
          </p>
          <p>
           <i> “Cannabis legalization is working in numerous states across the country, generating jobs and billions in
            revenue,” </i>says Flores-Williams, who is also an author and political activist, says. “So, why are we still
            using
            resources to prosecute it?&quot; Flores-Williams, who is also an author and political activist, says. <i>“So,
            why are we
            still using resources to prosecute it?</i>&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            In a joint statement regarding comprehensive cannabis reform legislation in the 117th Congress, Senators
            Cory
            Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in part:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>“As states continue to legalize marijuana, we must also enact measures that will lift up people who were
            unfairly targeted in the War on Drugs.&quot;</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            One of those people is Jonathan Wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>“Jonathan Wall is being prosecuted for the same activity that thousands, if not millions of people, are
            engaged
            in across the country, so this is an equal protection violation under the 14th amendment,” Flores-Williams
            says. “It would almost be a joke, if it weren’t so heartbreaking.&quot;</i>
          </p>
          <b>Jonathan Wall will go to trial in the U.S District Court of Maryland in May 2022</b>
